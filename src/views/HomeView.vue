			I am Mansang Jo, an enthusiastic, self-motivated, and confident software developer residing in Apple Valley, MN. 
			After graduating from University in South Korea with a degree in computer science, 
			I worked for four years at an IT company in the Gangnam area of the nation's capital, Seoul. 
			Upon moving to the United States in August of 2017, 
			I attended an intensive English language academy for five months and then started a rigorous coding program at Prime Digital Academy in Minneapolis to understand and learn how to interact and communicate with other developers or co-workers in the USA. 
			Now, I'm working remotely as a software developer.
